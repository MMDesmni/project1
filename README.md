# project1
Data analysis and Basic works on csv using pandas and DataFrame

there are 2 files and even my Data for you to train with:
-The datamaker file is a code that makes for you a Dataframe by using prepared data and random library and you could practice with it because every time you use it you have a diffrent and brand new data to use 
-The project1 file is the file that have everything about basi data analysis in ther

in this project at first we transform a excel file to csv for smoother code and executing
first we add some rows 
than we start by having some basic informations like maximum minimum mean and diffrent kind of information

After that we start organizing our information by using fill method to do not have any nan cells and we use diffrent methods for that like dropna or droping an entire coloumn
Than we nummeric all the data so it could be easier to calculate and we delete every data that might have been duplicated
Now we use a method to calculate most of the mathmatic by itself
Therefor we have a try and catch block and  an if block for having some Extra information about means and values of Orders
At last we use some exact methods to print an especial row or an especial coloumn(In this kind of work our job is so easier since we only work with certain coloumns or rows)
